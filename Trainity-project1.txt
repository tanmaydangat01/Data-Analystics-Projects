            Application in Real Life Scenario Case Study

Description:
The scenario focuses on the use of data analytics in the
transportation to optimize route planning and reduce travel time
for passengers to travel across different places.




Planning:
It is the basic step of gathering the requirements in data analytics.
It defines the goal of the objective to reduce the time taken by the
passenger in the transportation industry
Prepare:
In this step, we gather relevant data from various sources, such
as GPS tracking, traffic patterns, and public transportation
schedules.

Process:
Process transform the data into a usable format. Which includes
the execution and implementation of the routes and accessible
roads that reduces the travel time
Key Elements:




Analysis:
We have to choose that route which requires less time to reach
the destination . It may depends on the Traffic , the time it
requires to reach the destination , optimal travel times and based
on some other circumstances.

Share:
To identify the best routes which takes the optimal time than the
required time to reach the destination

Act:
Implement the suggested improvements, like adjusting routes and
schedules based on insights.
You finally choose that route after the analysis which required less
time to reach the different places.
